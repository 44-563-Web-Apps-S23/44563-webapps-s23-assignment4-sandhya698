            Bosworth Crocker was born March 2, 1882, in Surrey, England. While still

            In addition to _Pawns of War_ and _Stone Walls_, he has written a number
            of one-act plays, _The Dog_, _The First Time_, _The Cost of a Hat_, _The
            Hour Before_, _The Baby Carriage_, and _The Last Straw_.

        <p>
            _The Last Straw_, produced by the Washington Square Players in New York
            City, is an excellent one-act tragedy, based upon the psychological law
            of suggestion.

            THE LAST STRAW[G]<br>
            
            TIME: _The present day._<br>
            
            SCENE: _The basement of a large apartment-house in New York City._<br>
            <p>
                SCENE: _The kitchen of the Bauer flat in the basement of the Bryn
                Mawr. A window at the side gives on an area and shows the walk
                above and the houses across the street. Opposite the windows is a
                door to an inner room. Through the outer door, in the centre of the
                back wall, a dumb-waiter and whistles to tenants can be seen. A
                broken milk-bottle lies in a puddle of milk on the cement floor in
                front of the dumb-waiter. To the right of the outer door, a
                telephone; gas-range on which there are flat-irons heating and
                vegetables cooking. To the left of the outer door is an old
                sideboard; over it hangs a picture of Schiller. Near the centre of
                the room, a little to the right, stands a kitchen table with four
                chairs around it. Ironing-board is placed between the kitchen table
                and the sink, a basket of dampened clothes under it. A large
                calendar on the wall. An alarm-clock on the window-sill. Time: a
                little before noon. The telephone rings_; MRS. BAUER _leaves her
                ironing and goes to answer it_.
            </p> 
            <p>
                <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> No, Mr. Bauer's out yet. [_She listens through the
                transmitter._] Thank you, Mrs. Mohler. [_Another pause._] I'll tell him
                just so soon he comes in--yes, ma'am.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h6>[MRS. BAUER</h6> _goes back to her ironing. Grocer boy rushes into
                basement, whistling; he puts down his basket, goes up to_ MRS.
                BAUER'S _door and looks in_.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h6>LANE.</h6> Say--where's the boss?
            </p>
            <p>
                <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?
            </p>
            <p>
                [_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._
            </p>
            <p>
                <h6>LANE.</h6> Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
                groceries for Sawyers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> [_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
                which hangs beside the door._] Here.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h6>LANE.</h6> What's the matter?
            </p>
            <p>
                <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> [_Dully._] Huh?
